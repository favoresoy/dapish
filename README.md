## Project in a nutshell

Privacy and trust are the key enablers for the usage of any sensitive personal data. This is especially the case for health and social data. Many times, the sensitivity prevents the usage of data even in cases where actual personal data would not be needed. There is not enough quality research and development in the field of algorithms and open source software to facilitate transformation of personal data into non-personal data.

### 5 categories

Data principles project will classify personal data into five categories: 
1. Original data
2. Pseudonymized data
3. Anonymized data
4. Synthetic data
5. Fabricated data. 

We will explain each category in detail with specific use cases for health and social care and test and validate multiple open source libraries and algorithms to transform data from original data to each other four categories. 

### Stay tuned

The project will kick off during 2019. Stay tuned for updates.
